    - A library which manages net streams to prevent conflicts.
    - To utilize this library, include it in both realms and either:
        A)
            - Manually replace net.writeStream() and net.readStream() calls with
              safeStream.write() and safeStream.read() calls.
            - This is preferable if you wish to make use of this library's added features,
              such as canceling streams from either realm, or having callbacks on write.
        B)
            - Add the following code snippet after require()'ing the library:
                net.writeStream = safeStream.write
                net.readStream = safeStream.read
            - This will automatically make all streams safe, but isn't a clean code practice.
    - Note that if you also run ANY other chips which use net streams without this library,
        you will be vulnerable to conflicts again.
