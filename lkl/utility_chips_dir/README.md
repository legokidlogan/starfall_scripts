--[[ comment block so this doesn't break your Starfall chips


# Utility Chips Directory
Any starfall script placed in this folder will automatically be included and ran by [utility_chips.txt](/lkl/utility_chips.txt) \
This is to package all of your general-purpose utlity scripts into one chip, reducing your chip count and tidying things up.

By default, [utility_chips.txt](/lkl/utility_chips.txt) uses a hexagon model for the chip, as it works well with [undo_buffer.txt](/lkl/undo_buffer.txt) to create a buffer to stop you from accidentally undoing your utilities, with the hexagon making a pleasant pattern.
